    <p>
        Innocence Found is committed to advocating for those who have been wrongfully convicted 
        and working tirelessly to ensure justice prevails. Through investigation, legal support, 
        and public awareness, we strive to bring light to cases of wrongful conviction and help 
        restore freedom to the innocent.

    <p>
        Our organization brings together legal experts, investigators, and volunteers who share 
        a common goal: to right the wrongs of the justice system and support those who have been 
        unjustly imprisoned.
